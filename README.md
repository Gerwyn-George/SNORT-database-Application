# Snort-database-application
Final Year project (Information and Communications Technology Degree): Snort database application.

Python database application created as a submission for my final project for the Information and Communications Technology degree @ Staffordshire University. There was a requirement for an application to replace a solution currently in use, which was hindering the critical process of creating and deploying custom SNORT rulesets. 

As part of this project, user requirements were gathered, technologies suitable for the project was researched, an application designed, and an application created which could replace the current application. 

This application utilises the Pyside GUI library for GUI, while utilising the MySQL database connector library to facilitate database functionalities. 

This application allows users to do the following functions.
- Introduce Snort rules into a user defined MySQL database. 
- Filter Snort rules within database based upon set user criterion. 
- Search for Snort rules based on up to five set user criterion. 
- Create custom rulesets based upon set user criteron.
